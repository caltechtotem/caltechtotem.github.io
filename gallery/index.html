            <h2>By Danny Wendt</h2>
            <p>Painted using hand-processed natural pigments, "Driftless" is a map exploring the concepts of transition and change in my life growing up in the Driftless Region of southern Wisconsin. A glacial map of the region and a partial highway map layer together, representing glaciation as a transformative force on the body of the land and the liminal state of transition in driving between one place and another. Inset, the transformation of a native monarch's life cycle juxtaposes with personal transition.</p>

            <h2>By Katelyn Lee</h2>
            <p>3rd Place - Art of Science 2020-2021</p>
            <p>The race to the end of the pandemic has left behind a wake of masks. The figure here is Fred Lebow, founder of the New York Marathon, and suffocating him in a wave of litter are 26 discarded masks representing the 26 miles of the race, with the surgical blue masks at the center extended to the elaborate printed and even furry masks at the periphery.  This pandemic has certainly been a marathon: the spry beginning when masks were a rare and hoarded commodity, prized, expensively upsold, to the present slog to the end, masks carelessly tossed away to the ground, worthless.  Each mask here was photographed over the course of three runs--unable to do my research from home, tracking the volume of mask litter in Central Park became a personal project that forced me to reflect on the waste generated by the pandemic. I pass by Fred each time I run--and each time he looks to his watch, like we all do, waiting for the pandemic to meet its finish line.</p>

            <h1>Sorcery</h1>
            <h2>By Logan Apple</h2>
            <p>This is an example of fractal art, created through a set of mathematical transformations called an iterated function system. Blooms like this are created from a large number of transformations focused on petal shape, layering, and texture.</p>

            <h2>By Logan Apple</h2>
            <p>This is another instance of fractal art, created from a foci-spherical base. Highly geometric systems like this require fine tuning, carefully adjusting to avoid unintended chaos.</p>

            <p>2nd Place - Art of Science 2020-2021</p>
            <p>This type of fractal art is called a spherical plant, made to closely resemble grass or ferns. Wildfire was inspired by the fires that ravaged California and Australia last year, among all the others that continue to cause crises around the world.</p>
