					<!--<p><a href="events/img/artofscience.pdf">Flyer for event</a></p>-->
					<!--<p><a href="events/img/artofscience_literary.pdf">Flyer for literary AoS submissions</a></p>-->
					<p>Art of Science is a celebration of the aesthetics of scientific research and the way in which science and art inform each other. We hope to encourage the appreciation of this connection and provide an opportunity for members of the Caltech community to share the beauty of their work with others. Prizes are open only to undergraduates and graduate students, but works submitted by Caltech post-docs, faculty, and staff will still be considered for display in the exhibit. <b>Entries to the competition can be submitted at <a href="http://www.artofscience.caltech.edu">www.artofscience.caltech.edu</a> until January 31st, 2019.</b> Exhibitions from previous years' competitions are also available for viewing on the website.</p>
					<p>Submissions may include imagery created in the course of research, or 2D/3D art forms based on scientific subjects, tools, or concepts. They should consist of one or more images or videos along with a caption to explain the context of the piece. For microscope or telescope images, please include each image's dimensions in its description. Selected entries will be displayed in the Art of Science gallery in Chandler along with the three winning submissions.</p>
					<p>Prizes will be awarded for best entries in the following amounts:
					<a><center><b>First Place - $250.00
					<br>Second Place - $150.00
					<br>Third Place - $100.00</a></center></b>
