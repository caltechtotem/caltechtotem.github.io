				<h2>Current Contests</h2>
					<h3><a href="http://www.artofscience.caltech.edu">Art of Science</a></h3>
					<!--<p><a href="events/img/artofscience.pdf">Flyer for event</a></p>-->
					<!--<p><a href="events/img/artofscience_literary.pdf">Flyer for literary AoS submissions</a></p>-->
					<p>Art of Science is a celebration of the aesthetics of scientific research and the way in which science and 
						art inform each other. We hope to encourage the appreciation of this connection and provide an opportunity 
						for members of the Caltech community to share the beauty of their work with others. Prizes are open only to
						undergraduates and graduate students, but works submitted by Caltech post-docs, faculty, and staff will still
						be considered for display in the exhibit. </b> Exhibitions from previous years' competitions are also available for viewing on the website 
						(<a href="http://www.artofscience.caltech.edu">www.artofscience.caltech.edu</a>).</p>
						
					<p> <b>2020-2021 Art of Science submission deadline: March 19th, 2021. Submissions are currently being judged, look out for the winners soon!</p>
						
						
					<p>Submissions may include imagery created in the course of research, or 2D/3D art forms based on scientific subjects,
						tools, or concepts. They should consist of one or more images or videos along with a caption to explain the context
						of the piece. For microscope or telescope images, please include each image's dimensions in its description. 
						Selected entries will be displayed in the Art of Science gallery in Chandler along with the three winning submissions.
		
						For the 2020-2021 contest, submissions relating to experiences during the Covid-19 pandemic were also accepted, as many members of 
						the Caltech community have had to adapt to pursuing research differently.</p>
				
					<p>Prizes will be awarded for best entries in the following amounts:
					<a><center><b>First Place - $700.00
					<br>Second Place - $450.00
					<br>Third Place - $300.00</a></center></b>
