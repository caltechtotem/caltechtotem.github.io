		<h2>Totem Instagram Competition - Winter Term 2012-2013</h2>
		<p>Theme: Perspective. What does art look like to you? Pictures will be judged on creativity rather than technical excellence. Caltech affiliates submitted instagram and cell-phone pictures to the Totem Facebook page to be voted on in two rounds (first round by the number of likes, and the second round by the Totem Editors). </p>
		
		<p>The winning entry is below, submitted by Kelly Guan: <br><br>

		"The picture is of my international group form when I was studying abroad in Denmark last term. We all worked together to come up with the picture, which was for an orientation/team-building activity during our first week. We wanted to make something that stood out from the other groups, so we came up with as many wacky ideas as possible, which eventually led to this!"<br>
